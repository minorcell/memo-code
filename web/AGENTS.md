# Web Package Guide

This file defines local contribution rules for `web`.

## Scope

- Owns Next.js pages, components, and web-facing docs/presentation layer.
- Keep app behavior consistent on desktop and mobile breakpoints.

## Change Rules

- If public docs content, navigation, or examples change, keep related docs in sync.
- Keep web docs aligned with current package boundaries (`packages/tui` contains CLI entry and interactive UI runtime).
- Preserve established UI patterns unless a deliberate design change is required.
- 需要维护agents.md的更新。
